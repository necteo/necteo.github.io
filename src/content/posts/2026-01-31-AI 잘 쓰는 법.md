사실 클로드 잘 쓰는 법이다

인터넷 돌아다니다가 봤는데 그럴듯해서 기록용

Anthropic engineers just leaked their internal AI workflow.

Turns out, 99% of people are using LLMs completely wrong.

Here are 5 techniques that separate amateurs from experts:

1/ THE "MEMORY INJECTION" TECHNIQUE

Most people start fresh every time. Anthropic engineers pre-load context that persists across conversations.

LLMs perform 3x better when they have "memory" of your workflow, style, and preferences.

Example prompt to test:

"You're my coding

2/ REVERSE PROMPTING

Instead of telling the AI what to do, make it tell YOU what it needs.

Forces the model to think critically about requirements before executing. Reduces hallucinations by 40%.

Example prompt:

"I need to analyze customer churn data. Before you help, ask me 5 clarifying questions about my dataset, business context, and desired outcomes. Don't start until you have all the information."

3/ THE "CONSTRAINT CASCADE"

Don't give all instructions at once. Layer them progressively as the AI proves understanding.

Models perform better with incremental complexity. Think training weights, not dumping everything.

Example prompt:

"First, summarize this article in 3 sentences. [wait for response] Now, identify the 3 weakest arguments. [wait] Finally, write a counter-argument to each weakness."

4/ ROLE STACKING

Don't assign one role. Stack multiple expert perspectives simultaneously.

Creates internal "debate" that catches errors and blind spots.

Anthropic's research shows 60% improvement on complex tasks.

Example prompt:

"Analyze this marketing strategy from three perspectives simultaneously: a growth hacker focused on virality, a data analyst focused on metrics, and a behavioral psychologist focused on user motivation. Show all three viewpoints."

5/ THE "VERIFICATION LOOP"

Make the AI explain its reasoning, then critique its own explanation.

Self-correction before you see the output. Catches logical errors that slip past single-pass generation.

Example prompt:

"Write a Python function to process user payments. After writing it, identify 3 potential bugs or edge cases in your code. Then rewrite the function to fix those issues."

The difference between amateurs and experts isn't the AI they use.

It's how they structure the conversation.

These 5 techniques are used daily by Anthropic's AI research team.
Now you have them too.

Test them. Your output quality will never be the same.

Every week, my fellow experts and I are breaking down the two AI conversations literally shaping everything: ethics and money. Every Sunday, you’ll get:

🚀 One key trend in AI ethics
